🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

An interactive Machine Learning + Streamlit project that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

📌 Features

📂 Upload Titanic dataset (train.csv) directly in the app from data folder 

🔍 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with clear visualizations

📊 View an interactive classification report and metrics

🤖 Train a Logistic Regression Model for survival prediction

🎮 Try out custom passenger input to see survival chances

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data handling & visualization

Scikit-learn – for ML model & preprocessing

Streamlit – interactive web app
